# Apple Clone — README

Single-file README for an Apple-style marketing/landing site clone. Use this as the primary documentation for setup, features, and usage.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a front-end clone of Apple's marketing website (UI and layout only). The goal is to reproduce the look & feel for learning, UI practice, and portfolio demonstration. This clone **does not** use Apple's assets or code — swap any copyrighted imagery for your own or free alternatives.



## Features

- Responsive header with navigation and hero section
- Product showcase sections with grid and card layout
- Animated hero / subtle transitions (CSS-based)
- Footer with legal links and site map
- Accessible markup where possible (semantic elements, ARIA)

## Tech Stack

- HTML5 (single file)
- CSS3 (flexbox/grid, custom properties)
- Optional JS for small interactions (no frameworks)

## Installation / Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```
2. Open the project folder and open `index.html` in a modern browser.
3. For local development with auto-reload, serve the folder with a dev server (VS Code Live Server or `npx http-server`).

## Usage

Edit the HTML directly to change content, or separate styles & scripts into different files if you prefer a multi-file setup. Replace placeholder images located in `/assets` (or inline data) with your own optimized images.

## Folder Structure (Suggested)

```
apple-clone/
├─ index.html        # Single-file README + site or main html
├─ assets/           # images, icons, fonts (keep copyrights in mind)
│  ├─ img-hero.jpg
│  └─ product-1.jpg
└─ README.md         # this file
```

## Accessibility & SEO

- Use semantic tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`).
- Provide `alt` text for images and ARIA labels for interactive controls.
- Optimize headings order (H1 → H2 → H3) for screen readers and SEO.

## Customization Tips

- Swap fonts to mimic Apple's typography (e.g., `-apple-system`, Inter, or San Francisco) — ensure licensing for production.
- Use SVG icons and inline SVGs for crispness across devices.
- Lazy-load images with `loading="lazy"` and compress assets for performance.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Keep changes focused, open a PR with a clear description, and follow the project's coding style. If adding images or fonts, note their license in the PR.

This project is intended for educational and portfolio use. It **must not** be used to impersonate or misrepresent Apple Inc. or infringe on copyrighted assets (logos, product photos, trademarks).
